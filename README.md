#Cheery's Pygame Tutorial
This tutorial is a draft, it will change. If you have ideas of how to improve or continue this tutorial, tell about it in [issues page](https://github.com/cheery/pygame_tutorial/issues). Oh, and if you disagree with me about something then fork your own tutorial. ;-)

Before you start this tutorial, it'd be good to understand little bit of python already. What is a function, variable, loop, tuple, list, function call, import? I explain the rest as we go through this tutorial.

We start from this piece of code:

    import pygame, sys

    black = 0,0,0
    white = 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF
    background_color = 0x12, 0x0E, 0x1C

    def animation_frame(screen):
        screen.fill(background_color)

    def dispatch(event):
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            sys.exit(0)

    pygame.display.init()
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1024, 768))
    while 1:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            dispatch(event)
        animation_frame(screen)
        pygame.display.flip()

This code opens a display device through pygame and goes into an event polling loop. For every event, that was being received during last frame, it calls our dispatch -function, which determines what happens when it gets an event. We can see that a request to quit causes the process to exit.

Pygame gives our process either a real or virtual [framebuffer device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer). Process gets a memory buffer to fill with whatever we want. Actually it gets two such buffers to prevent [screen tearing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing) while animating. One buffer gets filled when an another is shown on the screen. Event loop calls display.flip at the end, which switches the roles of buffers, causing our animation to show up on the screen.
